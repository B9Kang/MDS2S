# Self-supervised learning for denoising of multidimensional MRI data
**Code for the paper**: Self-supervised learning for denoising of multidimensional MRI data, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2024): https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.30197

This repository contains the **official MD-S2S denoising implementation**.  

This repository provides a demonstration of our proposed MD-S2S (multidimensional Self2Self) algorithm.

This study is to develop a fast denoising framework for high-dimensional MRI data based on a self-supervised learning scheme, which does not require ground truth clean image.


## Code Availability

This repository includes:
- official implementation of the MD-S2S algorithm
- training and evaluation notebooks
- pre-trained model for DWI images
- in-house implemented patch2self
